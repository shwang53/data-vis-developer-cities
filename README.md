**Data Visualization Project**
- 
This project is based on my master program at UIUC, CS498 Data Visualization. It was created by D3.js and Vanilia JS. <br/>
URL: https://dev.suuk.gitlab.io/-/data-visualization-project/-/jobs/666403116/artifacts/public/dist/index.html (To be fixed)

**Messaging**
- 
This project narrows down to convey messages about where the most considerable place to live for software developers. I used three dataset(`Number of developers, Average salary, Cost of living` by states) to draw each chart to provide visualization to users. Letting viewers dive into charts friendly, it helps to compare the most appropriate state to live for software developers.

**Narrative Structure**
- 
This project adopts `interactive slide show` structures with `drill-down` of each scene. The characteristics of the structure is that, the author leads read-flow as charts are displayed in the order how the author set up. On purpose, I cast a doubt to make viewers think about the question, annd show three scenes that might be appealing and useful to viewers to resolve the curiosity. Also, each chart of the scene is interactive, which shows different results according to what viewers' choose.<br/>

**Two things that you could miss**
1. There is a filter for viewers to choose "top 10" or "top 3" states of data.
2. There is a hover effect for each chart. If a viewer hovers each rectangle in charts, it provides amount of difference between another states to compare easiliy (Drill-down part). 

**Visual Structure**
- 
 1. The header is located at the top large enough, and interactive with viewers by highlighting according to scroll up/down. This indicates what viewers currently see at the moment, which helps with understanding the entire layout and messages of the visualization.
 2. The introduction section is the first screen that a viewer face with when accessing through URL. This section draws a curiosity by highlighting some important keywords. Also, a viewer can slide right to see next information(three dataset) included in the section. In the last slide of the section, it indicates for viewers to see charts by scrolling down.
 3. Viewing direction is vertical rather than horizontal. It is intended to let viewers more freely see back and forth by scrolling up/down. 
 4. The color of charts unique. Also, the color of button when clicking is matched with its chart color. It is tiny detail, but keeps unified.

**Scene**
- 
Except for the introduction section, there are 3 main scenes. The scenes are ordered by broader questions that viewer might have. When choosing a location to liver as a developer, people might wonder if there are enough job openings, average salary, and then cost of living. In other words, it is ordered according to human-think-flow, which follows easily with viewers.
- Scene 1 : Number of software developer by states
- Scene 2 : Average annual salary of software developer by states
- Scene 3 : Cost of living index by states

**Annotation**
- 
Each scene has an annotation that remarks the the state that has the top figure. Also each figure is shown within the rectangle in each chart. They are helpful to understand the charts by highlighting the most remarkable figure, which is helpful for viewers to understand the visualization.

**Parameter**
- 
Each scene has a filter to view the chart. If `Top 10`is selected, it display figures of top 10 states about the topic. If `Top 3` is selected, then it displays only top 3 states. Therefore, viewers have control to see charts.

**Trigger**
- 
Each chart has a hover effect. If a particular state is hovered, its figure is hide and let viewers to compare with other states by showing the difference with lining. This connects viewers to see more detailed information about each chart.
